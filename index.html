    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Mark de Leon. I live in Quezon City, where my partner and I
      raise our beautiful 1 year old daughter, Amelie. Among the many
      experiences I've enjoyed in my 32 years of living, nothing tops being a
      dad. Fatherhood has created countless opportunities for me to grow as an
      individual while experiencing life through fresh eyes.

    <h2>Why I Choose Uplift</h2>
    <p>
      My journey to learn coding began when I read Satoshi Nakomoto's White
      Paper on Bitcoin. It was then that I realized how the language of coding
      can be used to impact the world in a beautiful way. I wanted to learn to
      read and write code ever since. After quite a bit of self-study, I found
      that I was bombarded with information overload and did not know where to
      begin. In comes Uplift, and the application process alone motivated me to
      create this page from scratch, and immediately I am uplifted.
